#Please complete the following While Programs, this is one submission.  Please submit this under WhilePgm2:
#Please complete the Algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart, test cases and the source code for the following programs:
#Program 1.  Write a program that prompts the user for a number and then sums the odd numbers from 1 to the number entered
#Program 2:  Write a program that prompts the user for a number and then displays its factorial.  The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers from 1 to the number.  
#For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

#program 1
number = int(input("Please input a number. "))
count = 1
value = 0
while(count <= number):
	if (count % 2 == 1):
		value += count
		count += 1
	else:
		count += 1
print("The sum of all the odd numbers from your number is: ", value)

#program 2
number_first = int(input("Please input a number. "))
number = number_first
factorial = 1
while (number > 0):
	factorial *= (number)
	number -= 1
	
print(number_first,"! =", factorial)
