#code: If the discriminant is negative, positive or zero
#The purpose of is code is to find the discriminant of a polynomial.

a = int(input("What is the number of a?: "))
b = int(input("What is the number of b?: "))
c = int(input("What is the number of c?: "))
discriminant = ((b*b)-(4*a*c))
if(discriminant < 0): print("No Root")
elif(discriminant == 0): print("One Root")
else: print("Two Roots")
